# Next.js 15 Asynchronous Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with asynchronous operations in Next.js 15.  The issue arises from improper handling of data fetching within functional components, potentially leading to hydration mismatches or rendering errors.

## Problem

Next.js 15 enforces stricter rules around asynchronous data fetching. If data isn't fetched and processed correctly before the initial render of a component, the client-side hydration process may fail, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using suspense or making sure data fetching is done before the component is rendered initially. This can be achieved using techniques like loading states or utilizing suspense for better user experience.
